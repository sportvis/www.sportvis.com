    <h2>What's new?</h2>
    <p>June 2008 -  After a long delay (and a bit of downtime), sportvis.com 
is on a new server. In the near future, I plan to convert this site to a 
blog format, making it easier to post more often.</p>
    
    <p>January 18, 2007 -  I've started posting data to my sister site,
    <a target='_blank' href='http://www.crashingthedance.com/'>Crashing the Dance</a>, where
    we use machine learning techniques to predict the selection and seeding 
    choices of the NCAA Tournament selection committee based on their 
    historical behavior.</p>
    
    <p>October 29, 2006 -  I'll be in Baltimore this weekend for
    <a target='_blank' href="http://conferences.computer.org/infovis/infovis2006/">InfoVis 2006</a>
    If you're at the conference, stop by and see my poster Monday night
    at the poster session.</p>
    
    <p>August 3, 2006 -  I just learned that my poster submission for the 
    <a target='_blank' href="http://conferences.computer.org/infovis/infovis2006/">2006 
    IEEE Symposium on Information Visualiizaton</a> (a.k.a., InfoVis 2006) has
    been accepted! InfoVis is the leading conference in the field, so this 
    is pretty exciting. Thanks to John Stasko, my infovis professor and 
    master's project advisor.</p>
    
    <p>July 1, 2006 - Today I'm giving a 
<a target='_blank' href='http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,1811,34,0'>presentation</a> 
at the Society of American Baseball Research (SABR) 
<a target='_blank' href='http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,1432,17'>convention</a> in Seattle. I will be
    talking about using information visualization (infovis) with baseball
    statistics by giving a brief infovis tutorial and showing the
    work I did at Georgia Tech.</p>
    <p>I will post slides and references from my
    talk shortly. I would like to post a version of the visualization tool I built, 
    but I need to get it to a point where I feel comfortable releasing
    it to the public.</p>
    
<h2>About SportVis</h2>
<p>SportVis will try to capture and publicize use of information visualization (infovis) with sports
statistical data. More importantly, we will help push further integration of sports and infovis.</p>
<p>
Major American sports generate substantial 
amounts of numerical data that lend themselves to statistical analysis. 
Primarily through the work of 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_James'>Bill James</a> 
and the availability of data on
the Internet, advanced baseball statistical analysis (typically called 
Sabermetrics) has gained substantial traction. 
More recently, other sports, including basketball (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.basketballonpaper.com/">Dean Oliver</a>, 
<a href="http://kenpom.com/">Ken Pomeroy</a>) and 
professional football (e.g., 
<a href="http://www.footballoutsiders.com/">Football Outsiders</a>) have
received analytical treatment. 
However, there is still a resistance among the general sports fan to
embrace this new lens through which to view the game. 
</p>

<p>
Some of this may be attributed to the often unsophisticated presentation 
of complex information, something to which information visualization is 
particularly suited. Unfortunately, there has been surprisingly little 
substantial application of information visualization to sports statistics.
Presentations of general information visualization systems 
(e.g., Spotfire) and techniques (e.g., treemaps) frequently use 
sports data as examples. There is a dearth of tools (the 
<a href='http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559229'>visualization of a tennis match</a>
is one notable exception) to help users with tasks specific to analyzing 
sports. Such tools could not only enhance the enjoyment of fans, but also
assist media coverage and team officials decision making.

<p>More to come soon...</p>
