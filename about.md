<h2>About SportVis</h2>
<p>SportVis will try to capture and publicize use of information visualization (infovis) with sports
statistical data. More importantly, we will help push further integration of sports and infovis.</p>
<p>
Major American sports generate substantial 
amounts of numerical data that lend themselves to statistical analysis. 
Primarily through the work of 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_James'>Bill James</a> 
and the availability of data on
the Internet, advanced baseball statistical analysis (typically called 
Sabermetrics) has gained substantial traction. 
More recently, other sports, including basketball (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.basketballonpaper.com/">Dean Oliver</a>, 
<a href="http://kenpom.com/">Ken Pomeroy</a>) and 
professional football (e.g., 
<a href="http://www.footballoutsiders.com/">Football Outsiders</a>) have
received analytical treatment. 
However, there is still a resistance among the general sports fan to
embrace this new lens through which to view the game. 
</p>

<p>
Some of this may be attributed to the often unsophisticated presentation 
of complex information, something to which information visualization is 
particularly suited. Unfortunately, there has been surprisingly little 
substantial application of information visualization to sports statistics.
Presentations of general information visualization systems 
(e.g., Spotfire) and techniques (e.g., treemaps) frequently use 
sports data as examples. There is a dearth of tools (the 
<a href='http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559229'>visualization of a tennis match</a>
is one notable exception) to help users with tasks specific to analyzing 
sports. Such tools could not only enhance the enjoyment of fans, but also
assist media coverage and team officials decision making.
